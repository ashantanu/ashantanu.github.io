# Jekyll Resume Theme
changes by me.
to run, go to this directory and run following
jekyll build
jekyll serve 
and then open http://localhost:4000


A mega simple Jekyll theme for displaying a resume/cv online.

The theme follows the default Jekyll build as closely as possible to avoid any dependency issues.

To customise you just need to fill out the `_config.yml` and the jobs and education `.yml` files in the `_data` directory with your own details.

You can see a demo of the theme at: [mattcouchman.co.uk/jekyll-resume](http://mattcouchman.co.uk/jekyll-resume)

Feel free to tear apart and rebuild as you wish.
